This directory contains the undocumented examples.  Documented examples can
be easiely generated by running `make -f Makefile.cvs configure` inside the
source's top-level directory.  It will prepend the descriptions contained in
"descriptions" in front of each example.  The resulting documented examples
can then be found inside the "build/examples" directory.

Note that in the (un)documented directories a symbolic link to a number of
data sets contained "data" is required to run the examples.
